## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1. Checkboxes should not use `display: none`, as it prevents keyboard navigation and toggling.

2. CSS outline property does not affect element width/height, unlike border or padding.
